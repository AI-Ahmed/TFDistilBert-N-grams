Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they‚Äôre observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

I decided to use the **Transfer Learning** in this project and **Fine-tune** it since I believe in not to re-invent the wheels. We're going to use one of my favourite libraries; it's **Hugging Face**. It is the library ‚Äì you need to use to inject your model with a pre-trained model that has trained on billions of examples.
